# Blazor.BroadcastChannel

This package wraps [Broadcast Channel API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API).

## Donating

My blog and open source projects are result of my passion for software development, but they require a fair amount of my personal time. If you got value from any of the content I create, then I would appreciate your support by [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/tpeczek) (either monthly or one-time).
